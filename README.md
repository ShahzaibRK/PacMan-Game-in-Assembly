Pac-Man Game in x86 Assembly (MASM + Irvine32)
Overview
This project is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Pac-Man game written in x86 Assembly language using MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) and the Irvine32 library. It showcases fundamental assembly programming techniques such as keyboard input handling, screen output, and simple game logic.

The game features:

Player-controlled Pac-Man character

Movement using arrow keys

Static maze layout with dots to collect

Score tracking on dot collection

Features
Arrow Key Movement: Navigate Pac-Man through the maze using keyboard arrow keys.

Dot Collection: Collect dots placed within the maze to increase your score.

Maze Display: Simple fixed maze rendered using console characters.

Score Display: Keeps track of collected dots and displays the current score.

Requirements
MASM32 or Microsoft Macro Assembler installed on Windows

Irvine32 Library (included or separately installed)

Windows OS (console-based application)

Setup and Running
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pacman-assembly.git
Open the project in your MASM IDE or editor of choice.

Assemble and link the program using MASM and Irvine32 library.

Run the resulting executable in the Windows console.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man through the maze.

Collect all dots to maximize your score.

The game runs in a console window and updates in real time.

Learning Outcomes
This project helps you understand:

Low-level programming with x86 assembly language

Keyboard input handling with the Irvine32 library

Basic game mechanics implementation at the assembly level

Working with console graphics and screen output
